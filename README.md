# SAT-Gurobi
An Efficient Method to Transform SAT problems to Binary Integer Linear Programming Problems ï¼ˆUnder Review)
Necessary environment:
1.Matlab
2.Gurobi Optimization
Running step:
1.Put data file into 'test' folder
2.Open Matlab run the file 'milp_jobNew.m'
3.The result will save current directory,if sat it will save path file into 'result' folder
